sic, the aggregate can play a vital role not only
at the immediate surface level, but at intermediate and background levels too:
the surface level is that of the array (an aggregate formed by concurrent, partial
unfoldings of twelve-note sets); the intermediate level is that of the lyne (a com-
positionally uninterpreted complete linear unfolding of a twelve-note set); the
background level is formed by the set-class underlying a particular passage
(where a set-class is the group of all sets which can be transformed into one

this fundamental emphasis derives from Schoenberg's dictum: >>... no tone is re-
